## The Problem
Vancouver Aquarium just shuttered its doors to the public due to the complications brought about by COVID-19 and the lack of visitors.

However, the conservation work carried out by Ocean Wise and the care for the Aquarium animals continues. The Marine Mammal Rescue Centre continues to be the sole centre in existence on Canada’s west coast equipped with carrying out important conservation work in saving the injured wildlife of the ocean.

## The Proposal
We’re proposing a web app that collects donations to sponsor the rehabilitation of mammals under the care of the Marine Mammal Rescue Centre (MMR).

Users can “adopt” a seal and be invited to journey along with their seal’s road to recovery.
